# Character Recogniser

This project was developed to be able to train image recognition models (Linear and Convolutional)
on the EMNIST dataset with varying model parameters (batch number, epoch number,
train/validation split). The models would then be able to make prediction on images provided to it by
the user through our GUI. 

Through our dataset viewer the user would be able to view all dataset images
and select images from the testing dataset to test the model with. The user would also be able draw
images onto a canvas and have the model process it and make a prediction of the letter/digit that was
drawn.

Our recognizer was developed to provide an opportunity for us to learn about different machine
learning models, how to use different models, as well as teaching us about python and how to make
python GUIâ€™s to allow user-friendly user interaction. There are many benefits to learning about image
recognition as it is currently transforming many industries around the world such as farming,
security, healthcare, automotive, etc. For example image recognizers looking at X-ray images can help
doctors diagnose patients, or farmers using image recognition to test the ripeness of produce. Although
our recognizer is not on the cutting-edge of current research it provides an easy to use system for
people to interact and test with models they test themselves.

The goal of this project is to design and implement a tool that recognizes handwritten digits and
English letters (lower and upper case) with a easy to user GUI. The wider goal of this project is to
teach software design & planning, team-work, and basic machine learning.
